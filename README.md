# Youtube Downloader Scripts
These scripts are for those who prefer a straightforward solution without having to dive into the documentation of yt-dlp.

These scripts utilize [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

Please note that yt-dlp is not developed by me.

## How to Use
### Running the Bat Files

- If the color of the "Paste your link" text changes, it indicates that the link has been successfully inputted.
- The file will download the media to the folder where the yt-dlp.exe is located.
